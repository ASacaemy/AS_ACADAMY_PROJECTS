🔢 Keypad & LCD Interface with Arduino
This project demonstrates interfacing a 4x4 Matrix Keypad and a 16x2 LCD with an Arduino UNO to display the key pressed. When any key on the keypad is pressed, its value is shown on the LCD screen.

🧠 Working Principle
A 4x4 matrix keypad has 16 keys arranged in rows and columns.

When a key is pressed, the row and column get connected.

Arduino scans each row and checks which column shows a signal.

The pressed key is identified using a keymap and displayed on the LCD.

LCD shows "Press a Key:" on startup and then displays the pressed key on the second line.

📟 Code Explanation
Uses Keypad.h library for scanning keys.

Uses LiquidCrystal.h for LCD interfacing.

lcd.begin(16,2) initializes the LCD.

keypad.getKey() checks for keypress.

Detected key is displayed using lcd.print().

📌 Applications
Can be used in Password-protected systems.

Basic input systems in menu navigation.

Useful in digital locks or voting machines.

Acts as a foundation for ATM simulation projects.

📝 How to Upload
